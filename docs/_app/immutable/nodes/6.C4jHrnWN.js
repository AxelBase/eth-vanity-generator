Since each hexadecimal character in an address is effectively random and independent, the chance of matching a specific prefix of length n is exactly 1 in 16^n. This exponential growth means that adding just one extra character multiplies the expected search time by sixteen.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">For a one-character prefix, there are only 16 possible values, so a match is expected within about 8 attempts on average. A two-character prefix requires around 128 attempts, three characters around 2,048, and so on. By the time you reach six characters, the expected number of attempts exceeds 16.7 million, and eight characters pushes it into the tens of billions.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Real-World Generation Times</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">A typical modern browser can perform between 20,000 and 50,000 address derivations per second. Using an average of 35,000 attempts per second provides realistic estimates. A four-character prefix usually completes in under a minute, five characters may take several minutes, and six characters can range from minutes to hours depending on luck.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Seven-character prefixes enter the realm of days or weeks on a single machine, while eight-character ones are generally considered infeasible in a browser environment. This is why most practical vanity addresses limit themselves to five or six characters at most.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Probability and Expected Attempts Table</h2> <ul class="svelte-1al8b51"><li class="svelte-1al8b51">1 character: ~8 attempts (instant)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">2 characters: ~128 attempts (instant)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">3 characters: ~2,000 attempts (seconds)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">4 characters: ~32,000 attempts (under a minute)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">5 characters: ~524,000 attempts (minutes)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">6 characters: ~8.3 million attempts (minutes to hours)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">7 characters: ~134 million attempts (hours to days)</li> <li class="svelte-1al8b51">8 characters: ~2.1 billion attempts (weeks or more)</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-1al8b51">The Role of Luck</h3> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">These numbers represent averages. Because the process follows a geometric distribution, it is always possible to get lucky and find a match much faster, or unlucky and take significantly longer. The probability of finding a match improves steadily with more attempts, but there is no guarantee of completion within a specific time frame.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Practical Recommendations</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">For most users, prefixes of three to five characters offer the best balance between distinctiveness and reasonable generation time. Six characters can be attempted with patience, while anything longer is better suited to dedicated tools or GPU-accelerated generators.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Why does difficulty increase so quickly?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Each new character adds four bits of entropy that must match exactly, multiplying possibilities by 16.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Is there a way to speed up longer prefixes?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Specialized vanity generators using GPUs or distributed computing can dramatically reduce time for longer patterns.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Does case matter in the prefix?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">No, matching is case-insensitive; the tool treats all input as lowercase for comparison.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Grasping these probabilities helps set realistic expectations and choose appropriate prefix lengths for your needs.</p></article></div>');function G(m){var e=_();g("1al8b51",h=>{var s=w(),b=f(u(s),6);a(4),r(()=>c(b,"content",`${o??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),v(()=>{y.title="Understanding Search Difficulty and Probability | ETH Vanity Generator Blog"}),i(h,s)});var t=l(e),d=l(t);a(4),n(t),a(2),n(e),r(()=>c(d,"href",`${o??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{G as component,D as universal};
