These options often prove more practical for many users and projects.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">The most popular alternative is the Ethereum Name Service, commonly known as ENS. It allows registration of human-readable names ending in eth that resolve to any Ethereum address. Users can point their ENS name to a regular address, avoiding the need for vanity generation entirely.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Ethereum Name Service Benefits</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">ENS names are fully customizable, support any characters including full words, and can be updated to point to new addresses without changing the name itself. This flexibility makes them ideal for long-term branding and simplifies sharing across platforms.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Resolution happens on-chain or through wallet integrations, meaning recipients see the friendly name instead of a raw address in supported interfaces. Many major wallets and dapps already display ENS names natively.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Contract-Based Vanity Solutions</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Advanced users can deploy contracts using the CREATE2 opcode to achieve predictable contract addresses. This technique allows calculation of a contract address before deployment, enabling vanity patterns in contract addresses without brute-force searching.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Projects often combine this with proxy patterns to create immutable vanity contract addresses that control upgradeable logic. The computational cost occurs once during deployment rather than repeatedly during key generation.</p> <h3 class="svelte-jo8es1">Other Approaches</h3> <ul class="svelte-jo8es1"><li class="svelte-jo8es1">Shortened address displays in wallets (first and last characters)</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">QR codes for safe sharing</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Address books and contact labeling in wallet software</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Domain-based payment links through services</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">When to Choose Each Option</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Vanity addresses work well for externally owned accounts needing a memorable hex pattern. ENS excels for human-readable names and flexibility. CREATE2 vanity contracts suit projects requiring predictable addresses. Many users combine multiple approaches for different needs.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Do ENS names replace the need for addresses?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">They supplement addresses; the underlying address remains necessary for transactions.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Are ENS names more secure than vanity addresses?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Security depends on proper management of the resolving address and name ownership.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Can I have both a vanity address and ENS?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Yes, point your ENS name to your vanity address for maximum recognition.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Understanding available alternatives helps choose the most appropriate solution for each use case.</p></article></div>');function k(p){var e=w();j("jo8es1",h=>{var t=E(),v=u(y(t),6);s(4),r(()=>i(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),f(()=>{g.title="Alternatives to Vanity Addresses | ETH Vanity Generator Blog"}),o(h,t)});var a=n(e),m=n(a);s(4),l(a),s(2),l(e),r(()=>i(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(p,e)}export{k as component,V as universal};
